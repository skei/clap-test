in progress, in motion, ..

------------------------------
bugs/issues
------------------------------

* render length

  max(midi_length,audio_input_length)
  make sure both audio and midi reader handles eof

----------

------------------------------
features
------------------------------

* audio input/effect

  this should already be working, but untested..

----------

* sidechain audio input

  for compressors
  additional AudioFile, plus command line arguments for specifying
  connection to port/channel.. then send additional buffer in process()

----------

* midi cc -> paramter

  in midi-player, catch specified cc midi events when preparing events
  before processing, send param events instead of midi

----------

* midi output

  for midi generating plugins
  need a midi writer

----------

* tests

  -T <value>
  value = int/bitflag, so we can test everything

  ways we can test a plugin?
  (command line flags)
  stress testing, "spec compliance", robustness
  multiple instances
  rapidly and chaotic opening/closing editor,
  parameters out of range
  buffers out of range (sizes)
  null pointers
  in-placve (input = output buffer ptrs)

----------

* extensions

  implement more extensions, both on the plugin and host side

------------------------------
improvements
------------------------------

* printf()

  tweak printf output for easier (machine) parsing
  (failure, success, warning, info..)

----------

* arguments

  the current one is just confusing and complicated..
  also, the curent scheme is getting a bit restricted if we want to add
  multiple audio/midi inputs, outputs, parameters, etc..

----------

* events

  we create and delete events for every audioblock now, and we also search
  through every event in every track to find events within specified time
  segment.. not particularly good for performance.. but i don't think it's
  that much of a problem.. this isn't meant for realtime usage..
