in progress, in motion, ..

------------------------------


* audio input/effect

  this should already be working, but untested..

----------

* render length

  max(midi_length,audio_input_length)
  make sure both audio and midi reader handles eof

----------

* arguments

  the current one is just confusing and complicated..
  also, the curent scheme is getting a bit restricted if we want to add
  multiple audio/midi inputs, outputs, parameters, etc..

----------

* block size fuzzing

  random blocksizes
  keep track of total number of samples we need to render

----------

* midi cc -> paramter

  in midi-player, catch specified cc midi events when preparing events
  before processing, send param events instead of midi

----------

* midi output

  for midi generating plugins
  need a midi writer

----------

* sidechain audio input

  for compressors
  additional AudioFile, plus command line arguments for specifying
  connection to port/channel.. then send additional buffer in process()

----------

* and always: cleanup, bug fies, etc..
